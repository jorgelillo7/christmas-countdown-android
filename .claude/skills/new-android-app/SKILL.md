# New Android app

Process used for the decision wheel (app #2). Keep the user in the loop at the three decision
points marked **🛑 ask**; everything else you can do on your own. Write in English; talk to the
user in their language.

## 1. Understand the idea

Restate the idea in two lines: what the user decides/does with it, for whom, offline or not.
Default constraints in this repo: **local only, no backend, no ads, no tracking**, English +
Spanish, simple scope.

## 2. Competitor study (Google Play)

```bash
for q in "<keyword 1>" "<keyword 2>" "<spanish keyword>"; do
  curl -s -A 'Mozilla/5.0' "https://play.google.com/store/search?q=${q// /%20}&c=apps&hl=en" \
    | rtk proxy grep -oE 'details\?id=[A-Za-z0-9_.]+'
done | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -25
```

For the top ~12 ids, fetch `https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=<id>&hl=en` and extract
title, downloads (`>[0-9.,]+[KMB]?\+<`), rating (`Rated ([0-9.]+) stars`), "Contains ads",
"In-app purchases" and the description (`data-g-id="description"`). One WebSearch for review
complaints ("<category> app reviews too many ads / I wish") gives the pain points.

Summarise for the user: a table (app, downloads, rating, ads, standout feature), what users
complain about, and **honestly** whether there is room for something different. "Nothing new,
but done well and without ads" is a valid outcome.

## 3. 🛑 ask: scope, design, name

Propose 3–5 differential ideas ranked by value/effort and let the user pick (AskUserQuestion,
multi-select). Keep v1 small.

Design: render 2 palette proposals of the app's key screen with Pillow and `open` the PNG on the
user's Mac (they can't see your Read images). Rules that worked: one background (light or dark),
5–6 accent colours with similar saturation (cohesive, not a rainbow), never two equal colours
adjacent, dark text on light accents.

Name: check it on Play (`search?q=<name>`); avoid generic names that already have dozens of
apps. Pick a package id that never changes: `com.jorgelillo.<name>`.

## 4. Scaffold

Follow [docs/adding-a-new-app.md](../../../docs/adding-a-new-app.md). Checklist:

- `apps/<app>/domain` (pure Kotlin: all rules, unit tested) and `apps/<app>/app` (Compose UI).
- Register both in `settings.gradle.kts`.
- Before adding a library, read its AAR `minCompileSdk`/`minAndroidGradlePluginVersion`
  (see the upgrade-android-deps skill) and add it to `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- Persistence: DataStore (+ kotlinx.serialization JSON for small object graphs). Room only when
  queries/relations justify it.
- Copy from Christmas Countdown: signing block and build types in `app/build.gradle.kts`,
  `proguard-rules.pro` (RoomDatabase keep rule if WorkManager/Glance/Room is pulled in),
  splash theme, edge-to-edge in `MainActivity`, About sheet with privacy + rate links.
- Strings in `values/` and `values-es/` from the start.
- `./gradlew :apps:<app>:domain:test :apps:<app>:app:lintDebug :apps:<app>:app:assembleDebug`

## 5. Assets

- Icon: copy `apps/christmas-countdown/tools/generate_icon.py`, change geometry/palette; it emits
  adaptive + monochrome + legacy PNGs + `store/play-icon-512.png`. Look at the result.
- `tools/smoke_test.sh` and `tools/capture_store_screenshots.sh` from Christmas Countdown, using
  `scripts/tap-text.sh` labels (never coordinates).
- `store/metadata/android/{en-US,es-ES}/` with title (≤30), short (≤80), full description,
  `changelogs/1.txt`.

## 6. Repo bookkeeping

- Privacy policy: `privacy/<app>/index.html` in `~/Projects/jorgelillo7.github.io` (copy the
  Christmas Countdown one) and an app card in the pinned "Apps" block of `index.html` and
  `en/index.html`. Publish only after the user previews it.
- `apps/<app>/README.md`, `OPERATIONS.md` (uppercase), `release-notes.md`; add the app to the
  root README table, `docs/README.md` per-app table and `PENDING.md` (its own section).
- Branch + PR; the user merges.

## 7. First release

Hand over to the `release-android-app` skill. For a brand-new app the Play Console also needs:
create app, register the package name in Android developer verification, App content
declarations and a new upload key: the user runs `scripts/new-upload-key.sh <app>` in their own
terminal (never ask for the password in chat), then backs it up off the Mac ([docs/signing.md](../../../docs/signing.md)).
