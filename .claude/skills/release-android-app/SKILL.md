description: Prepare and ship a new version of one of the apps in this repo to Google Play: bump versionCode, write release notes in every language, build and verify the signed bundle, smoke test the release build, then guide the user through Play Console (internal testing, production, store listing). Use when the user wants to publish, release, upload or ship an app or a new version.

# Release an app to Google Play

Ask which app (`apps/<app>`) if there is more than one. Full background:
`docs/publishing-on-google-play.md`. App-specific commands: `apps/<app>/OPERATIONS.md`.

## 1. Version

- Current `versionCode`/`versionName`: `apps/<app>/app/build.gradle.kts`.
- The new `versionCode` must be higher than anything ever uploaded. Ask the user to confirm the
  latest in Play Console → App bundle explorer if unsure.
- Bump both values; add a row to `apps/<app>/release-notes.md`.

## 2. Release notes

Write `apps/<app>/store/metadata/android/<locale>/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt` for every locale
folder (≤ 500 chars, user-facing, no technical jargon). Then give the user the Play Console
block, one tag per language:

```
<es-ES>
…
</es-ES>
<en-US>
…
</en-US>
```

## 3. Build and verify

```bash
source scripts/env.sh
./gradlew test :apps:<app>:app:lintDebug :apps:<app>:app:bundleRelease
scripts/emulator.sh start          # ask the user to close Chrome first (8 GB RAM)
apps/<app>/tools/smoke_test.sh     # release build: must print SMOKE TEST PASSED
scripts/emulator.sh stop
scripts/verify-bundle.sh apps/<app>/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
open -R apps/<app>/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

Check in the `verify-bundle.sh` output:
- `versionCode` is the new one (a stale bundle from an earlier build is easy to upload by mistake).
- Signature serial matches the app's upload key (see `apps/<app>/OPERATIONS.md`). "NOT SIGNED"
  means `apps/<app>/keystore.properties` is missing: the user runs `scripts/new-upload-key.sh <app>`
  in their own terminal (docs/signing.md); never ask them to paste passwords into the chat.
- New permissions vs. the previous release → the Data safety form may need updating.

If the app has no `tools/smoke_test.sh` yet, create one from
`apps/christmas-countdown/tools/smoke_test.sh` (adapt package and tap coordinates).

## 4. Store listing (only if features changed)

- Update `full_description.txt`/`short_description.txt` per locale.
- New screenshots: `apps/<app>/tools/capture_store_screenshots.sh`, then
  `.venv/bin/python apps/<app>/tools/generate_store_assets.py`. Look at the images before handing
  them over.
- Tell the user to publish the listing **together with** the release (never before it).

## 5. Commit and PR

Commit version bump, notes and assets on a branch; open a PR; the user merges. Build the bundle
from the merged `master` if anything changed after the smoke test.

## 6. Guide the user through Play Console

1. Test and release → Testing → **Internal testing** → Create release → upload the `.aab` →
   paste notes → save → review → roll out. Install it on a real phone from the opt-in link.
2. When it's fine: **Production** → promote or create release with the same bundle.
3. If the listing changed: update it in every language and save (don't send yet).
4. Publishing overview → optionally **Managed publishing** → **Send changes for review**.

Expected review warnings that are OK: "devices no longer supported" after raising `minSdk`;
"native code without debug symbols" (AndroidX `.so` files). Anything else: ask for a screenshot.

## 7. After approval

Ask the user to install from Play on a real phone; note anything learned in
`docs/lessons-learned.md` and `apps/<app>/release-notes.md`.
