### Principles

- **Each app is a self-contained folder** under `apps/`, with its own `app` and `domain` modules.
- **Domain modules are pure Kotlin** (no `android.*`): fast to test and easy to move to another
  build system later.
- **Shared code lives in `core/`, but only once a second app needs it.** No empty modules "just
  in case".
- **Configuration is written once** in `build-logic` convention plugins and the version catalog.

## 🚀 Building

Requirements: Android Studio 2026.2+ and Android SDK 37. See [docs/setup/toolchain.md](docs/setup/toolchain.md).

```bash
source scripts/env.sh                                      # Android Studio's JDK, adb, SDK paths

./gradlew test                                             # unit tests for every module
./gradlew :apps:christmas-countdown:app:installDebug       # run on a device or emulator
./gradlew :apps:christmas-countdown:app:bundleRelease      # Play Store bundle
```

## ➕ Adding a new app

Two Gradle files of a few lines each, plus registering them in `settings.gradle.kts`.
Full recipe (modules, icon, privacy policy, store assets): [docs/adding-a-new-app.md](docs/adding-a-new-app.md).

## 📚 Docs

Start at [docs/README.md](docs/README.md): publishing checklist, toolchain notes, lessons learned.

## 🔐 Signing

Each app reads its release signing values from a git-ignored
`apps/<app>/keystore.properties`:

```properties
storeFile=/absolute/path/to/upload-key.jks
storePassword=...
keyAlias=...
keyPassword=...
```

## 🧭 Roadmap

- **Now:** one repo, Gradle, more apps added as folders under `apps/`.
- **Later:** possible move into a larger monorepo. The pure Kotlin domain modules are the parts
  designed to migrate first.
