# 🕵️ Who's lying? · ¿Quién miente?

**The impostor word game for groups, on one phone. Free forever: every pack, no ads, no subscriptions.**

</div>

## ✨ Features

- 🎭 **Classic:** the impostor gets a *similar* word and doesn't know they're the impostor
- 🙈 **Blind:** the impostor gets no word (optionally the category) and must bluff
- 🤷 **The Drifter:** classic plus a player with no word who wins by guessing it when voted out
- 🌀 **Chaos:** some games get a random number of impostors… sometimes everyone
- 📦 21 built-in packs, 600+ words per language (Spanish, English), each with two similar words, written for this app; multi-select grid
- 📝 **Your own packs:** one word per line, `word / similar / similar…` (similar words are optional; the impostor gets one at random)
- 🔁 No word repeats until ~90% of the chosen packs were played, then the oldest come back first; setup shows how many are left
- ⏱️ Optional discussion timer before each vote (1–5 min, tap to pause, beeps at zero)
- 📘 In-app guide to every mode (home → Modes, or "Which mode?" in setup)
- ⚙️ Settings: in-app language (Android 13+), share with friends, rate, privacy
- 🚫 No ads, no accounts, no network, no data collected

## 🏗️ Architecture

| Module | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `domain` | Pure Kotlin: roles and dealing (`Game.deal`), votes, drifter guess (accent/case-insensitive), outcomes, chaos, word picker, built-in packs. Unit tested. |
| `app` | Compose UI, one `GameViewModel`, DataStore JSON (players, settings, custom packs, recent words), navigation-compose. |

In CLASSIC/DRIFTER modes impostors see exactly the same screen as civilians (just a different word),
so nothing gives them away. Only players without a word are told their role.
