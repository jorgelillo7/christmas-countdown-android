## Report-a-word form

"Report this word" (result screen) opens a Google Form **in the browser**, prefilled with the word,
the impostor's word, the pack, the language, the reasons ticked in the app and the comment. The
player only taps *Enviar*. The app itself never goes online.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Public form (what players see) | https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf36XFjNcuWZLrEj4Msc01SdGrY8a-2GlxUy_DqQ-quov1dAQ/viewform |
| Apps Script project | "Script - ¿Quién miente? · Reportar palabra": https://script.google.com/home/projects/1FNOkHu9I9jCSLiGsM6TFvQ6dToGux63-maHfHmXYkFcYOqSnybrjeCzC/edit (only Jorge's account can open it) |
| Form and responses sheet | Jorge's Google Drive: "¿Quién miente? · Reportar palabra" and "¿Quién miente? · Reportes" |
| Script source | `tools/create_report_form.gs` (the copy in Apps Script is the same code) |
| Form URL and field ids used by the app | `app/src/main/kotlin/com/jorgelillo/whoslying/ui/Report.kt` (`WordReport`) |

**Changing texts** (title, description, thank-you message, question titles): edit the form directly
in Google Forms. Field ids don't change, so the app keeps working.

**Adding or replacing fields, or recreating the form** (the script always creates a *new* form):

1. Edit `tools/create_report_form.gs` here, paste it into the Apps Script project above, save and **Run** `createReportForm`.
2. From the execution log, copy the `Prefilled:` link. It holds the new form URL and one
   `entry.<id>=<PLACEHOLDER>` per field (placeholders are just markers; players never see them).
3. Update `FORM_URL` and the `entry.*` constants in `WordReport`, ship a new version.
4. Keep the old form open until most players have updated (old versions still point to it), then
   close it in Forms (*Responses → Accepting responses: off*).

Opening the `Prefilled:` link yourself shows the placeholders (PALABRA, PARECIDA…); that's
expected. The app replaces them with the real values.
