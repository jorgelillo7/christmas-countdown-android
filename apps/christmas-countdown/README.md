## 🏗️ Architecture

| Module | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `domain` | Pure Kotlin: countdown and advent rules, carol scores, music-box synthesiser. Unit tested. |
| `app` | Compose UI (MVVM: `ViewModel` + `StateFlow`), DataStore settings, Glance widget, audio playback. |
| `:core:designsystem` | Shared theme (`LilloTheme`) and components (`GlassCard`, `GradientBackground`). |
