# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repo is

A Gradle multi-project hosting several small Android apps published on Google Play. Each app is a
self-contained folder under `apps/<app>/`; shared Compose code lives in `core/`; shared build
configuration lives in `build-logic/`. Human docs are in `docs/` (index `docs/README.md`, repo runbook `docs/operations.md`); open work in `PENDING.md`;
each app has its own `apps/<app>/OPERATIONS.md` (exact commands) and `release-notes.md` (version history).

Apps today: `christmas-countdown` (`com.jorgelillo.christmascountdown`, live on Play) and
`decision-wheel` ("What next?", `com.jorgelillo.decisionwheel`) and `whos-lying`
("Who's lying?", `com.jorgelillo.whoslying`), the last two not released yet. Write code,
docs and scripts so they work for any app.

## Environment

Always `source scripts/env.sh` before running Gradle from a terminal: it points `JAVA_HOME` at
Android Studio's bundled JDK (the shell's default Homebrew JDK is too new for Gradle) and exports
`ADB`/`ANDROID_HOME`.

The machine has 8 GB RAM: emulator + Android Studio + Gradle don't fit together. Stop the emulator
(`scripts/emulator.sh stop`) during long builds and run emulator scripts in the foreground
(background jobs get killed under memory pressure).

## Commands

Module paths follow the folders: `:apps:<app>:app`, `:apps:<app>:domain`, `:core:<name>`.

```bash
./gradlew test                                            # every unit test in the repo
./gradlew :apps:<app>:domain:test --tests '*SomeTest.someMethod*'   # single test
./gradlew :apps:<app>:app:lintDebug                       # lint (kept at 0 warnings)
./gradlew :apps:<app>:app:installDebug                    # run on emulator/phone
./gradlew :apps:<app>:app:bundleRelease                   # Play bundle (signed if apps/<app>/keystore.properties exists)

scripts/emulator.sh start|stop|date MMDDhhmmYYYY|date auto|demo on|off
scripts/screenshot.sh <out.png>                           # dismisses "isn't responding" dialogs first
scripts/tap-text.sh "<label|test tag>"                    # tap by on-screen text or Compose test tag (never coordinates)
scripts/verify-bundle.sh <aab>                            # signature, versionCode, permissions, native libs
apps/<app>/tools/smoke_test.sh                            # release APK on emulator (per app)
```

Asset generators (icons, store graphics, developer profile) are Python + Pillow:
`scripts/setup-python.sh` once, then `.venv/bin/python <script>`. Generated images are committed;
regenerate them instead of editing by hand.

Project skills in `.claude/skills/`: `new-android-app` (competitor study → design → scaffold),
`upgrade-android-deps` (toolchain/dependency upgrades) and `release-android-app` (ship a version).

## Build architecture

- **Version catalog** `gradle/libs.versions.toml` is the single source of truth for every version,
  including `compileSdk`/`targetSdk`/`minSdk`, which the convention plugins read from it.
- **Convention plugins** in `build-logic/convention` (included build): `jorgelillo.android.application`,
  `jorgelillo.android.library`, `jorgelillo.android.compose`, `jorgelillo.jvm.library`. They set
  SDK levels, Java 17 target and core library desugaring, so module build files only declare
  namespace, app id/version, signing and dependencies.
- **AGP 9 has Kotlin built in**: never apply `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android`. The Compose compiler
  plugin is still needed (applied by the compose convention plugin).
- AndroidX versions are chained to compileSdk/AGP (e.g. Compose 1.12+ needs compileSdk 37 and
  AGP 9.1+). If `checkDebugAarMetadata` fails, bump the platform/AGP, not a single library.
- Type-safe project accessors are on: `implementation(projects.apps.<appCamel>.domain)`,
  `implementation(projects.core.designsystem)`. New modules must be included in `settings.gradle.kts`.

## App architecture (conventions for every app)

- `:apps:<app>:domain` is **pure Kotlin, no `android.*`**: all business rules live here, unit
  tested with `kotlin.test`. This keeps them portable (a later move into the `lillorepo` Bazel
  monorepo starts with these modules).
- `:apps:<app>:app`: Compose + Material 3, MVVM (`ViewModel` + `StateFlow`, collected with
  `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`). No DI framework: app-wide singletons live on the app's
  `Application` subclass and reach ViewModels through `viewModelFactory` companions.
- `:core:designsystem` holds `LilloTheme` (each app passes its own `ColorScheme`) and shared
  components (`GlassCard`, `GradientBackground`). Move code here only once a second app needs it.
- Strings ship in English (`values/`) and Spanish (`values-es/`); keep both in sync, including
  plurals (Spanish needs `one`/`many`/`other`).
- Snapshot tests pin anything users already see that is derived algorithmically (e.g. Christmas
  Countdown's yearly advent door order); don't change those algorithms.

## Releasing (any app)

- **Always test the release build** (`apps/<app>/tools/smoke_test.sh`), not just debug: R8 strict
  full mode (AGP 9 default) once stripped WorkManager's `WorkDatabase_Impl` constructor and the app
  crashed on start. Any app using WorkManager/Glance/Room needs the `RoomDatabase` keep rule
  (see `apps/christmas-countdown/app/proguard-rules.pro`).
- Signing reads `apps/<app>/keystore.properties` (git-ignored, values trimmed). Never commit it or
  any `.jks`; check `git status` for filename variants (a leading-space copy once slipped in).
- Each release bumps `versionCode` in `apps/<app>/app/build.gradle.kts` and adds
  `apps/<app>/store/metadata/android/{en-US,es-ES}/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt`.
- Store listing texts/images live in `apps/<app>/store/metadata/android/<locale>/` (fastlane
  supply layout). Publish the listing together with the release that adds what it describes.
- `targetSdk` must meet Google Play's current requirement (API 36 since Aug 2026).
- Privacy policies are served from the separate repo `jorgelillo7/jorgelillo7.github.io`
  (`/privacy/<app>/`), never from this repo, so renaming this repo can't break them.
