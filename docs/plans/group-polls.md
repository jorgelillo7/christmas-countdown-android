# Plan: "¿Qué votáis?" group polls app

Status: **built, waiting on the Firebase project and the Play Console app** (2026-10-07). App on an
in-memory backend + Firestore implementation (lillo-android-apps), rules + 22 emulator tests +
moderation + Terraform (lillorepo `packages/group_polls`, `infra/group_polls.tf`), `/q/`,
`assetlinks.json` and privacy page (jorgelillo7.github.io), all local until the OK.

## Why

A friend wants to know what the group voted. One person asks a question, shares a link on WhatsApp,
and the people they invite answer with their names visible. Android only for v1 (iPhone users left
out on purpose, fine for now).

## v1 scope (decided 2026-10-07)

Two kinds of poll, both with exactly **two answers, red vs blue**:

- **Public**: anyone can create one; it shows in the feed for everyone; results are percentages,
  never names. Shareable by link too.
- **Private**: only people with the link can open it; results show **who voted what**.

Common rules:

1. First launch: type your name (no accounts). Anonymous Firebase auth underneath.
2. Create: question + red label + blue label, public/private, duration chosen by the creator
   (**1 day / 7 days / no limit**).
3. Vote is **final**, followed by a **prediction** of which side wins (Wii homage); your prediction
   accuracy is kept on the device.
4. Share on every poll: `https://jorgelillo7.github.io/q/?c=<code>` (App Link into the app,
   fallback page to Google Play).
5. Moderation from day one (public UGC by anyone, Google Play UGC policy): terms accepted before the
   first public poll, report on every public poll, hide polls from a creator, auto-hide after N
   reports, es/en word blocklist on create, manual removal by Jorge.
6. "Borrar mis datos" in the app and on a web page.

Out of v1: free-text answers, Google sign-in, answering from iPhone/web.

Infra note: **lillorepo is not touched for now**. The GCP/Firebase project is created by hand;
adopting it in `lillorepo/infra` Terraform comes later. Spark plan (no billing) means no Cloud
Functions: every invariant lives in security rules + client.

## Decisions (2026-10-07, round 2)

- Feed: **last 7 days**, **sections per language** (es / en; the poll stores the creator's language).
- Public polls **show the creator's name**.
- The creator can **close** a poll, never delete it (nobody loses their vote).
- **App Check (Play Integrity) from day one**, enforced on Firestore; debug provider for emulators.
- "Borrar mis datos" **anonymises**: name and own polls' creator name removed, votes stay counted.

## How lillorepo does it, and what differs here

- `biwenger-tools` and `be-water-app`: Firestore `(default)`, Native, **`europe-southwest1`**,
  delete protection on, €1 budget alert, settings in `lillorepo/infra` Terraform.
  **Same for this project.**
- Access there is **server-side only** (Cloud Run service accounts, ADC). No client SDK, so no
  security rules, no Firebase Auth/App Check and no Firebase CLI: nothing to reuse for that part.
- Here the Android app talks to Firestore directly, so rules are the security boundary:
  - **Deploy rules** with Terraform (`google_firebaserules_ruleset` + `release`) once the project is
    adopted in lillorepo; until then from the Firebase console (copy of the file in the repo).
  - **Test rules** against the Firestore emulator. Options: gcloud's `cloud-firestore-emulator`
    component (official, `gcloud components install`), or `firebase-tools` pinned as a local
    (not global) dev dependency from npm. Needs Java 21 for the emulator (the Mac default is 8;
    use the JBR that `scripts/env.sh` sets).

## Architecture

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Android app | `lillo-android-apps/apps/group-polls/` (`domain` + `app`), package `com.jorgelillo.grouppolls` | Same conventions as the other apps |
| Firestore + anonymous auth + App Check | Its **own new GCP project**, Firestore in `europe-southwest1` (third one, next to `biwenger-tools` and `be-water-app`; nothing shared with them) | Firebase Spark/free tier at this scale; anonymous auth gives one answer per device |
| GCP project infra | `lillorepo/infra` Terraform, third project next to `biwenger-tools` and `be-water-app` | Project created by hand then adopted: APIs, `(default)` Firestore database, anonymous auth config, €1 budget alert |
| Firestore security rules + indexes | Next to the app in `lillo-android-apps` | Change with the code; tested with the Firebase emulator; deployed with the Firebase CLI |
| Invite links | `jorgelillo7.github.io`: `/.well-known/assetlinks.json` + `/q/` fallback page | Query string because GitHub Pages can't serve made-up paths |
| Privacy policy | `jorgelillo7.github.io/privacy/group-polls/` | First app that stores data: name + answers |

Data model (draft): `questions/{code}` (text, type, options, creator uid + name, createdAt,
closed) and `questions/{code}/answers/{uid}` (name, option or text, answeredAt). The document id
being the uid makes "one answer per device" a rule, not app logic. The random code is the access
key: rules only allow reading a question by its exact id (no listing).

## Steps

1. **Design doc review**: screens, data model, security rules, link flow. Decide the name.
2. **GCP project**: create by hand, adopt in `lillorepo/infra` (APIs, Firestore, anonymous auth,
   budget). Firebase project linked to it; Android app registered (`google-services.json`).
3. **Runbook MD** (`apps/group-polls/OPERATIONS.md` + a section in lillorepo `infra/README.md`):
   every command and console link: create/adopt project, `terraform plan/apply`, Firebase CLI
   login, deploy rules and indexes, run the emulator and rules tests, App Links verification,
   costs and how to check them, how to delete a user's data.
4. **Security rules first**, with emulator tests (create, answer once, can't read without code,
   can't edit others' answers, delete own data).
5. **Domain + app**: name, create, invite, answer, results, home; deep links.
6. **Links**: `assetlinks.json` (with the upload key and Play App Signing fingerprints) and `/q/`
   page on the site.
7. **Play**: privacy policy, Data safety (name, user id, user content), UGC report + delete data,
   store listing, internal test with the friend group.

## Open questions

- ~~App name~~ **Chosen: "¿Qué votáis? Sondeos" / "What do you vote? Group polls"** (same
  question-to-the-group family as "¿Qué hacemos?" and "¿Quién miente?"). Package
  **`com.jorgelillo.grouppolls`** (permanent once published), folder **`apps/group-polls`**. Check Google Play for clashes before publishing. Not "Canal
  Opiniones": that is the official Spanish name of Nintendo's Wii "Everybody Votes Channel"
  (trademark + Play impersonation policy).
- Look and feel: an homage to the Wii channel is fine in mechanics (vote, predict the majority,
  red vs blue) and in a light, rounded, early-2010s style of our own. No Nintendo assets, Miis,
  channel-menu layout, fonts or sounds.
- Question lifetime: close manually, or auto-close / auto-delete after N days (cheaper, more
  private).
- Can the creator delete a question for everyone? (Yes, probably.)
