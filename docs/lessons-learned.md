# Lessons learned

Short, one line each. Add to it whenever something bites.

- **Test the release build before uploading.** v4's toolchain upgrade crashed on start only in
  release (R8). `tools/smoke_test.sh` exists for this.
- **Verify the bundle you upload** with `scripts/verify-bundle.sh`: version, signature, permissions.
  A stale `.aab` from an earlier build is easy to grab by mistake.
- **Inactive developer accounts get closed.** Log in and ship something at least once a year.
- **Keep the keystore and its password backed up outside the repo.** Without them you need an
  upload key reset (days).
- **Files with a leading space** (` keystore.properties`) dodge `.gitignore`. Check `git status`
  before committing anything near secrets.
- **Don't host the privacy policy in a repo you may rename**: GitHub Pages URLs don't redirect.
- **Stacked PRs**: merging the base PR with `--delete-branch` closes the child PR. Retarget the
  child to `master` first.
- **Don't publish a store listing ahead of the release** that adds the features it describes.
- **The emulator is heavy on this Mac.** Run capture/test scripts in the foreground with Chrome
  closed; background jobs get killed under memory pressure.
- **`.properties` files are read as ISO-8859-1.** A UTF-8 "ó" in a path broke
  `keystore.properties`. Keys now live in `~/Projects/documentation/keys/<app>/` (ASCII, no spaces),
  and `scripts/new-upload-key.sh` still escapes non-ASCII as `\uXXXX` just in case.
- **Compose dialogs are separate windows**: `testTagsAsResourceId` set on the activity content does
  not reach them; set it on the dialog modifier too, or UI scripts cannot find their buttons.
- **Keep `@Serializable` classes in a module with the serialization plugin.** Missing it compiles
  fine and crashes at runtime ("Serializer for class … is not found").

- **Screenshots in the middle of a drag:** `adb shell input swipe` releases at the end, so a
  "hold to reveal" screen is already closed when you capture it. Drive the finger by hand:
  `adb shell input motionevent DOWN x y`, a few `MOVE x y`, `screencap`, then `UP x y`.

- **Test short landscape screens too.** Handhelds like the AYN Thor run phone apps on a wide, low
  screen: a layout that only fits portrait cut the reveal text, shrank the drawing canvas to a
  stamp and hid the players on the vote screen. Rotate the emulator
  (`adb shell settings put system user_rotation 1`) and check every screen; `isShortScreen()`
  (height < 480 dp) switches to compact layouts.
- **Smoke tests uninstall first.** Once an app has an upload key, its release build is signed
  differently from the debug build on the emulator and `adb install -r` fails with
  `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`.
